    <p style="font-style:italic">"The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of inestimable value, greater even than that of any other art. The main reason for this pre-eminence is that, as sacred song united to the words, it forms a necessary or integral part of the solemn liturgy." Sacrosanctum Concilium ¶ 112</p>
    <p style="font-style:italic">"The singing of the Church comes ultimately out of love. It is the utter depth of love that produces the singing. 'Cantare amantis est,' says St. Augustine, singing is a lover’s thing. In so saying, we come again to the trinitarian interpretation of Church music. The Holy Spirit is love, and it is he who produces the singing. He is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit who draws us into love for Christ and so leads to the Father." - Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, The Spirit of the Liturgy, p. 142</p>
    <p style="font-style:italic">"Whether it is Bach or Mozart that we hear in church, we have a sense in either case of what Gloria Dei, the glory of God, means. The mystery of infinite beauty is there and enables us to ex­perience the presence of God more truly and vividly than in many sermons." - Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, The Spirit of the Liturgy, p. 148</p>

    <p>The liturgies of the Ecclesia institute will form an important and vital part of your growth in faith this summer. We turn to our mother, the Church, at whose feet we sit to learn to pray, through Her liturgical traditions. Sacred music plays a vital role in these liturgies, for it clothes the Word of God with splendor and beauty, and enables us to better worship God and grow in holiness.</p>
     
    <p>This summer, our liturgies will draw on the Church's vast treasury of sacred music as a means of drawing the hearts of all deeper into the mystery of God. Whether it be Gregorian chant, chant in English, choral music, or sacred organ music, the liturgical music at Ecclesia will strive to cultivate singers' talents in creating sublimely beautiful music in order to convey the reality of the earthly liturgy as a reflection of the Divine liturgy taking place continuously in heaven. The music, though varied, will reflect a fidelity to the Church's liturgical texts.</p>

    <p>There are two levels of participation available to those who would like to take part in the music program at this summer's institute:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rehearsal 5 days/week for 45 minutes, singing at most of the institute's liturgies</li>
      <li>Rehearsal 2 days/week for 45 minutes, joining with the above group, singing at Sunday and feast day liturgies</li>
    </ul>     

    <p>The following will also be a part of this summer's institutes for all participants:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The celebration of the extraordinary form of the Roman rite twice throughout the institute. All other liturgies will be in the ordinary form of the Roman rite.
      <li>Twice weekly talks about sacred music and the liturgy to help you grow in your love and appreciation for our Church's beautiful traditions and liturgy.</li>
    </ul>
     
    <p>For those who are interested in a more intensive study of sacred music, the following option is available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Private lessons in singing and/or directing Gregorian chant as arranged with the Music Director</li>
    </ul>
