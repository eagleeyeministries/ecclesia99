      Participants from all over the United States will enjoy a month of prayer, community, and intellectual formation with three Brothers and one Apostolic Sister. Join us as we kick off the Ecclesia program with four days of back packing in the Badlands and then dive into the New Evangelization together. We want to help form evangelizers and leaders, those wanting to be Saints wherever they find themselves in the Church.
