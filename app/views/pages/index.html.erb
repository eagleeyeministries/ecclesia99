      WELCOME to Ecclesia, where leaders of the Church are formed and where God's mission is made manifest in the Living Church! We invite you to join us this summer. Purify your mind and heart, reach new depths in your study of theology and philosophy, and surrender to a deeper discovery of prayer and charity.
    </p>
    <p class="extra-bottom">
      In response to Pope John Paul II’s call to a New Evangelization, Ecclesia offers you the opportunity to earn undergraduate, graduate, or continuing education credits, all while experiencing a summer of prayer, evangelization, and fellowship with future leaders of the Catholic Church from across the country.

      Participants from all over the United States will enjoy a month of prayer, community, and intellectual formation with three Brothers and one Apostolic Sister. Join us as we kick off the Ecclesia program with four days of back packing in the Badlands and then dive into the New Evangelization together. We want to help form evangelizers and leaders, those wanting to be Saints wherever they find themselves in the Church.
